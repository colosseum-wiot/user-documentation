Introduction
===========

The Colosseum is a large-scale wireless network emulator that provides a platform for wireless experimentation. It uses a Massive Channel Emulator (MCHEM) to create realistic wireless environments for testing and evaluating wireless systems.

This documentation provides details about the various RF scenarios available in the Colosseum system. These scenarios are designed to emulate different wireless environments with varying characteristics such as:

* Path loss models
* Channel taps and delays
* Center frequencies
* Node mobility patterns
* Traffic patterns

Scenario Types
-------------

The Colosseum scenarios can be broadly categorized into:

1. **Test Scenarios**: Basic scenarios with controlled parameters for testing and calibration.
2. **Cellular Scenarios**: Scenarios that emulate cellular network environments in urban settings.
3. **Arena Scenarios**: Digital twin scenarios based on the Arena testbed at Northeastern University.
4. **Qualification Scenarios**: Scenarios designed for qualification and benchmarking.
5. **Channel Sounding Scenarios**: Scenarios designed to study channel emulation behavior.
6. **Fixed Pathloss Scenarios**: Scenarios with fixed path loss values for all links.
7. **Real Field Scenarios**: Scenarios that emulate real-world environments like Tampa, FL or Waikiki Beach.
8. **Anechoic Chamber Scenarios**: Scenarios that emulate anechoic chamber environments.

Each scenario is identified by a unique RF ID and has specific parameters that define its behavior.
