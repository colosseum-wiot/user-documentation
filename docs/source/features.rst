Features & Access
===================

Accessibility
------------

Colosseum is remotely accessible to users and operates 24/7/365. Users can reserve Colosseum resources through a simple web interface. Emulation jobs can be done either:

* Manually in an interactive session during the scheduled time
* As batch jobs that run automatically per user's instructions

Container Environment
-------------------

Colosseum provides users with preconfigured and ready-to-use LXC containers for basic testing. Users can customize these containers based on their needs to develop and implement their own radio codes. These customized container images can be uploaded to the Colosseum servers, and users may choose to load the default or customized containers onto the SRNs during their reserved session.
