**Narrative**

This set of scenarios replicates an outdoor environment, specifically emulating a portion of Waikiki Beach in Honolulu, HI, USA. The original goal of these scenarios is to simulate the movement of a ship performing radar operations and a cellular network, consisting of 1 Base Station (BS) and 6 User Equipments (UEs). The BS needs to detect the incumbent radar and react accordingly. To detect the incumbent transmissions, it leverages a sensor node located in the same position as the BS.

These scenarios have been created and validated via the CaST toolchain, which combines OpenStreetMap for the STL model generation and Matlab Ray-tracing for channel estimation.

**Node Placement**

The locations of the nodes in Waikiki Beach aim to reflect a generic combination of static BS and UEs, with a mobile ship moving along the beach in a linear trajectory at a constant speed of 10 m/s. The BS location is sourced from the OpenCelliD database of real-world cellular deployments, while the UEs are randomly scattered along the beach.

**Scenario 45101**

Contains 8 nodes with the ship moving along the beach at 10 m/s for 40 seconds.
