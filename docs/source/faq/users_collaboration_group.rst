Colosseum Users Collaboration Group
=================================

The Colosseum Users Group is a public collaboration forum for Colosseum users to share questions related to the use of reservation portal, containers, scripts, etc, as well as to share the development of new open-source toolchains, codes, and emulation models with their counterparts. Every Colosseum account holder can ask to join the Colosseum Users Group: https://groups.google.com/g/colosseum-users

.. note::
    Users should use the same email address as registered in their Colosseum account to request to join the Google Group, otherwise your request will be rejected.

The technical documentations, users FAQs and tutorials are available on this Colosseum knowledge base, which should be your first reference. Please "search" and "consult" the Colosseum knowledge base articles before you post a new conversation in the Users Group. If you cannot find the answer to your question in Colosseum knowledge base, first "search" the posts in Colosseum Users Group since your question might have been already asked and answered by other users. If no answer comes up, please create a new conversation and post your question by following the guidelines below.

.. note::
    If you are facing a technical issue related to Colosseum that requires Colosseum administration team considerations, and/or are not able to find or receive the answer to your question in Colosseum Users Google Group, please contact the Colosseum team by creating a new ticket.

**Guidelines for posting in the group**

- Take the time and formulate your question carefully. Give meaningful subject line, because most people just scan the subject lines. If it does not catch their attention, they will just skip your question and it will go unanswered.

- If your question is unrelated to a topic or message please "do not" reply to that message and change the subject line, because the archiver will attach your message to that unrelated thread. Create a new message instead.

- Note that this is a public discussion list and anything you post will be archived and accessible publicly. Group owners and managers do not moderate the posts, but will keep the right to delete any inappropriate posts.
