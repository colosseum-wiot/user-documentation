Office Hours
==========

Office Hours for Colosseum users are held **biweekly** on Thursdays at 3:00 pm ET to 5:00 pm ET starting on Oct. 22nd 2020.

To schedule a meeting, please get in touch with us explaining in details what your question/questions are so that appropriate Colosseum representative/s can be assigned to schedule a meeting with your team.

.. note::
    - Office hours are offered in 15 minutes time-slots. In the description of your request, you can indicate your preferred time-slot within the 2hrs window (3pm - 5pm ET on Thursdays). Time-slots will be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis and based on the availability of Colosseum Administration and Technical Support representatives. If your preferred time-slot is already taken, the first available time-slot will be allocated to your team.
    - The deadline to request a meeting is at the EoB of the first day of the week in which you would like to schedule the office hour, e.g., the deadline to submit a request for a meeting on Thursday of a given week, will be 5:00pm ET of Monday of the same week. Teams will be notified of their meeting time-slot and online call-in info.

Prerequisites for Office Hours
----------------------------

Please note that new users are expected to first complete the :doc:`Colosseum Tutorials </tutorials/index>` and run their first basic experiment before asking for an office hour meeting if they only have questions on setting up their environment and running an experiment. Questions that are generally covered in the tutorials and knowledge base articles will not be considered for office-hours meetings, and the users will be pointed to specific documentations that covers their question. If a question still persists, please explain the issue with sufficient details in your meeting request.
